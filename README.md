# sql-data-warehouse-project
Build a modern data warehouse with SQL Server, including ETL processes, data modelling and analytics.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a modern SQL Server–based data warehouse using a layered Bronze–Silver–Gold architecture to support reliable analytics, business intelligence, and downstream use cases such as ad-hoc analysis and machine learning.

The focus of this implementation is on data transformation, modelling, and analytics readiness, following ELT principles commonly used in modern data platforms.

## Specifications

- **Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
- **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
- **Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
- **Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
